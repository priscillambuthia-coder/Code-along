 ### Description
The website allows you to keep track of all the places you've been. Each destination should be an object with multiple properties, like location, landmarks, time of year, notes, etc. Display those properties when a user clicks on a place's name.

### Test Driven Development
This website works if the user follows this steps:
Fill out the form with your destination details,
Click "Add Destination" to save it,
Your destinations are saved and then appear below in beautiful cards,
Click "Delete"  if you no longer want to see your destination



### Features
It features :
Destination objects with properties: location, landmarks, time of year, and notes(e.g their favourite experience or feelings concerning such landmark).
Once the destination has been inputed it is displayed in a clean form.
Styling has been used to improve the appearance of the website.
It allows users to delete their input if they no longer want it.
Destinations are saved even after closing chrome making it easier for one to remember.
It also features a responsive design that works on various media

### Warmup question answers
#### Creation of object using constructors and literal notation
-By using literal notation we are very repetitive in order to achieve the desired number of the objects
-Constructor functions s a special type of function that is used to make an instance of a type of object.
-Constructors make it way easier this is because there's  far less code making it more scalable
#### Beneficts of constructors
-Reduce the amount of work load of coding
-Easy to use
-Can be used for making multiple objects.
-Require methods learnt during introduction to Javascript
#### Prototypes
 A prototype is an object that contains the functionality of a specific object type that is added as a property to the object we're working with.
 We choose to add methods to the prototype of an object type so that we can define the method once, but all object instances still have access to that method. This saves memory and is therefore more efficient. This is in contrast to adding a method to the constructor. In this case, when an instance of an object is created so is a new instance of that method (and any other properties), which takes up more memory.
